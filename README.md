# Stardew Valley Helper App - Current Functionality

This is a companion app for *Stardew Valley*, designed to help organize and display information about the game. Currently, the app allows users to:

- **View all crops** sorted by season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)  
- **Add new crops** via a form (name, growth time, sell price, and season)  

**NOTE:** The current “Add Crop” form functionality may not reflect how a typical Stardew companion app would work in real life (since crops are usually pre-defined). However, this form-based approach was intentionally implemented to demonstrate mastery of the Django concept for Module 2. Future iterations could replace the form with a community-center-style checklist or pre-loaded crop data for a more practical user experience.
